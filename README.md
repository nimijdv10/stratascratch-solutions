# StrataScratch Solutions – SQL & Python Data Analysis

This repository contains my solutions to selected **StrataScratch** data analysis problems, implemented using **SQL** and **Python (pandas, NumPy)**.

The focus is on demonstrating clear analytical thinking, clean code, and practical data manipulation techniques commonly used in data analyst and analytics-focused roles.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Practice real-world data analysis problems
- Strengthen SQL and Python (pandas) proficiency
- Demonstrate problem-solving and reasoning, not just final answers
- Build a transparent, well-documented analytics portfolio

---

## 🧠 Approach

For each problem, I:
1. Summarize the problem in my own words  
2. Identify the required metrics and logic  
3. Apply appropriate SQL or Python techniques  
4. Write clean, readable, and reproducible solutions  

Problem statements are **intentionally paraphrased** to respect StrataScratch’s content ownership.
